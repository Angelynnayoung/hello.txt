Hello.txt is is a file required by Code:You for partial fulfillment of the Final GitHub Review assisgnment. 
  I do not know what text I am supposed to have so I will just say how much I've enjoyed working in the Code:You Program. I will chose my pathway as web development. I was going to chose Data Anayitics but I do not have the time to dedicate to learn a whole new language and quickly. I have had some experience with JavaScript, HTML and CSS for over the past yeaar working through FreeCodeCamp curriculum. So I chose Web Development. I cannot wai to see what I will learn in this patway. THANK YOU for the opportunity.
